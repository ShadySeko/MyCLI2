# MyCLI

## Welcome! This repository contains my implementation of a CLI with a faboulous purpose: reverse text!

This CLI command, **reverse**, takes as input a text file and reverses it's content, basically writing it backwards.
To build this project, clone this repository, and build it inside the directory with the following terminal command:
```
mvn clean package
```
provided if you have maven installed.
This will create a .jar file, which you can then run with the following command: 
```
java -jar target/untitled-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
